# Program Language

## Introduction

### Syntax

A programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions (for lexical structure) and Backus–Naur form (for grammatical structure). 

### Semantics

The term semantics refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their syntax.

### Type System

A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. 

#### Typed language versus untyped language

#### Static typing versus Dynamic typing

In static typing, all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. In dynamic typing, determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with run-time values rather than textual expressions.

#### Weak typing versus Strong typing

Weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, but strong typing not.

### Standard library

Most programming languages have an associated core library (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.

## Paradigm Programming

* Imperative Programming (IP) 命令式编程
* Functional Programming (FP) 函数式编程
* Logic Programming (LP) 逻辑式编程

过程（procedural）、面向对象（object-oriented）、函数（functional）、泛型（generic）、元编程（metaprogramming）
