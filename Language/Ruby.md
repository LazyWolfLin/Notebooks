# Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## Future

### Seeing Everything as an Object

In Ruby, everything is an object. Every bit of information and code can be given their own properties and actions. Object-oriented programming calls properties by the name instance variables and actions are known as methods.

### Flexibility

Ruby is seen as a flexible language, since it allows its users to freely alter its parts. Essential parts of Ruby can be removed or redefined, at will. Existing parts can be added upon. Ruby tries not to restrict the coder.

### Blocks

A programmer can attach a closure to any method, describing how that method should act. The closure is called a block and blocks are inspired by functional languages.

### Mixin
Unlike many object-oriented languages, Ruby features single inheritance only, on purpose. But Ruby knows the concept of modules. Modules are collections of methods. Classes can mixin a module and receive all its methods for free.

### Others

* Ruby has exception handling features, like Java or Python, to make it easy to handle errors.

* Ruby features a true mark-and-sweep garbage collector for all Ruby objects. No need to maintain reference counts in extension libraries.

* Writing C extensions in Ruby is easier than in Perl or Python, with a very elegant API for calling Ruby from C.

* Ruby can load extension libraries dynamically if an OS allows.

* Ruby features OS independent threading.

* Ruby is highly portable: it is developed mostly on GNU/Linux, but works on many types of UNIX, macOS, Windows, DOS, BeOS, OS/2, etc.
